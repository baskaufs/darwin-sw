== Importing terms from other namespaces/ontologies ==

  # Menu --> File --> Open from URL (or open a local, downloaded copy)
  # Menu --> Ontologies --> Show all ontologies
  # Now, when adding a term, you will be able to link to these new external terms, e.g. {{{ :hasLocation rdfs:range :Ocean <http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location> .}}}
