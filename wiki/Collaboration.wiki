#summary Conventions and rules for collaboration

= Collaboration =

== Ontology files ==

It is expected that most people will use an ontology editor (like [http://protege.stanford.edu/ Protege] to edit the ontologies, so these files:

  * Should be saved as RDF/XML 
  * Should not include hand-written comments

== SVN access ==

All source files and wiki files can be accessed and edited via an SVN client.  For first checkout:

{{{
$ svn checkout https://darwin-sw.googlecode.com/svn/ darwin-sw --username foo.bar
}}}

This will make a directory called `darwin-sw` under SVN control.  It will include the contents of the wiki.  The standard work cycle is:

{{{
$ cd .../darwin-sw
$ svn update
... edit files
$ svn add foo  # for any new files
$ svn ci -m "An informative comment"
}}}

You will be asked for a username (`foo.bar` if you are `foo.bar@gmail.com`) and password (obtained via your googlecode settings page; _not_ your main gmail password).
