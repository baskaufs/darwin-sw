#summary The dwc:Identification class

= The dwc:Identification class =

The dwc:Identification class connects an [ClassIndividual individual organism] to a [ClassTaxon Taxon].  Taxon is understood to be an instance of a taxon concept or taxon name usage (see the discussion of the [ClassTaxon Taxon class]).  A particular individual organism may be assigned several identifications.  Each identification should be a separate instance of Identification.  

== Notes on the Identification class==
No distinction is made between the initial identification and subsequent identifications made by persons who "annotate" evidence (e.g. specimens) at a later time.  "Identification" in this case is synonymous with "determination"; therefore the person doing the identifying could be referred to as the "determiner" rather than the "identifier" (to avoid confusion with use of "identifier" as in "globally unique identifier").^1^ ^2^ ^3^

The term identificationReferences is "a list of references
used in the assessment to make the determination. The dwc:identificationReferences might include taxonomic treatments, but they might also include something such as an expert range map or a field guide".^4^  identificationReferences is a string literal property populated with a concatenated text list of sources that were consulted.  dwc:identificationReferences is distinguished from dwc:nameAccordingTo which is a property of Taxon.  nameAccordingTo is intended to convey the publication which establishes the concept by circumscription or description of the characters which delineate the taxon.^4^ ^2^   (See the [ClassTaxon Taxon class] for more on this.)
