#summary The Occurrence class

= The Occurrence class =
The Occurrence class represents instances where the presence of an organism at a location is documented.  It functions primarily as a node that connects IndividualOrganisms to Events as well as to evidence that supports the record.  In DSW, the Occurrence class differs somewhat from DwC because some terms in the DwC Occurrence class are placed within the Specimen class of DSW.
