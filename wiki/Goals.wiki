#summary Goals and design principles for this project

= Goals =

  * Develop a vocabulary and simple ontology for sharing biodiversity data on the semantic web
  * Initially focused more on Linked Open Data applications than machine reasoning, but (hopefully) making design choices that do not constrain full SW reasoning downstream 
  * To only using DwC terms and classes unless there is something really fundamental that is missing

== Design principles ==

  # If a DwC (or DC) Class exists, for (essentially) the same concept that we would like to use, we will use the same Class name, and the DwC or DC namespace.
  # We will link DwC superclasses (Occurrence, Event, dcterms:Location, !GeologicalContext, Identification, Taxon) with new dsw namespace properties, which will have an explicit domain and range.
  # New concepts that we think are fundamental to the SW-ization of DwC will be added as new Classes with new linking predicates (with domain and range specified). E.g. Individual.
  # We propose a re-conceptualization of Occurrence to be not the physical or digital record of the Organism, but the abstract presence of the organism in space and time.  These Occurrences are recorded (hasEvidence) by a range of tokens.  We do not establish a token class, but create, or import Classes of, e.g., Specimen, !DigitalStillImage, Observation, etc, and specify them as being the range of hasEvidence.
  # We will avoid using much of the http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/ vocabulary because its status and permanence is not clear.  This means we need to re-create several classes such as Specimen.
  # For the numerous object and data properties in DwC, we neither specify domains or ranges, but add a comment in our ontology about suggested domain, and suggested data type of range (e.g.,   dwc:eventDate, dwc:identifiedBy)
  # In accordance with LOD principles, we expect all resources referred to to have URIs.
