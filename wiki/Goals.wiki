#summary Goals and specific design principles for this project

= Goals =

  * Develop a vocabulary and simple ontology for sharing biodiversity data on the semantic web
  * Initially focused more on Linked Open Data applications than machine reasoning, but (hopefully) making design choices that do not constrain full SW reasoning downstream 
  * To only using DwC terms and classes unless there is something really fundamental that is missing
