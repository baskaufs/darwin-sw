#summary Summary of an email discussion about the nature of specimens, documents, and individuals

=Introduction=
Beginning on 2013-04-03, there was an off-list email discussion about the nature of specimens.  Most of the participants in the discussion were present at the RCN4GSC planning meeting in Seattle from 2013-03-26 through 2013-03-29, although several were not.  This page was created with the implied consent of the participants to archive that conversation.  The discussion was not directly related to Darwin-SW and was placed in this wiki simply as a matter of convenience.

At the RCN4GSC meeting, there was an informal discussion that started with a discussion of the sampling process and drifted to the topic of "what is a living specimen?".  The Darwin Core type vocabulary includes dwctype:LivingSpecimen as a term theoretically suitable for use as an object of dwc:basisOfRecord .  In that discussion, I brought up the case of the Bicentennial Oak which is part of the Vanderbilt Arboretum.  The Vanderbilt Arboretum is a collection (having URI http://biocol.org/urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:35259 ) which contains living specimens in the form of trees.  Most of these trees were planted intentionally and that planting could be broadly construed to be part of a material sampling process.  However, the Bicentennial Oak (having URI http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/7-314 ) predates the university.  I believe that it is a dwctype:LivingSpecimen even though nobody actually did anything to cause it to be there in the arboretum.  I asserted that it was different than a tree in a forest (e.g. http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/ind-baskauf/51010 ) which is an organism we could document but which I would not call a dwctype:LivingSpecimen.  I said that there was something about the process of accessioning the tree, asserting that it was part of the arboretum, and making some kind of commitment that it would remain available for examination in the future that made it a dwctype:LivingSpecimen , things that don't apply to a tree that we just find in the forest.  That was about all the further we got in the discussion before we moved on to other things.

I've had this kind of discussion before about what makes a starfish in a jar on a museum collection different from a starfish on a beach.  Aside from deadness (which isn't really relevant because the starfish could be alive in a tank), what makes the two different?  I usually come across as a nutcase after such discussions.  However, I coincidentally was made aware of http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/whatdoc.html in the context of a discussion about "documents" in the context of Audubon Core.  The section "The antelope as document" on that webpage gets at exactly the issue I was discussing above.  In the case of that section, the term "document" is used rather than "specimen" but I would assert that they are functionally the same.  In this section Briet's rules for determining when an object has become a document (think specimen) involve:

1. intentionality

2. processing

3. perceived to be a document (specimen)

Applying these rules to the Bicentennial Oak and the tree in the forest, the Bicentennial Oak is a document/specimen because we intend for it to be one, we have processed it (e.g. it has been included in the records of the arboretum), and we perceive it to be one (we advertise it as part of the arboretum, a thing we don't do for the tree in the forest). 

With reference to the Darwin-SW viewpoint, we have invented a class we call dsw:Token .  There is no requirement for class membership other than that the dsw:Token should be used as some kind of evidence:
1.  evidence that an organism was at a place at a certain time (i.e. "organism at a place and time" is what DSW considers to be an Occurrence; the evidence is the object of the dsw:hasEvidence property with the Occurrence as the subject)
2.  a physical or information-resource voucher of the organism (the object of dcterms:hasPart or foaf:depiction with the organism as the subject)
3.  evidence for an identification instance (the object of dsw:idBasedOn with the Identification instance as the subject)
This is very similar to Briet's concept of a "document".  She considers that the antelope in a zoo is a document because "it has become physical evidence being used by those who study it" in a way that it was not when it was running wild on the plains of Africa.  If you drill down and look at the RDF of the Bicentennial Oak  and the tree in the forest (http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/7-314.rdf and http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/ind-baskauf/51010.rdf respectively), you'll notice that the Oak serves as the evidence for the Occurrence of itself:

http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/7-314#occ dsw:hasEvidence http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/7-314

while the tree in the forest does not have itself as the evidence for it's own occurrence.  That's because the Bicentennial Oak meets the requirements of Briet while the tree in the forest doesn't.

I realize this is a rather esoteric point, but if we are getting serious about ontology development and thinking about how we intend to use dwc:basisOfRecord with the Darwin Core type vocabulary, we should consider these points.  It seems to me that dwc:basisOfRecord has (or should have) a lot in common with dsw:hasEvidence.  The object of dwc:basisOfRecord is the evidence upon which the record is based and could be a dwctype:PreservedSpecimen, dwctype:LivingSpecimen, dwctype:MachineObservation, dwctype:MaterialSample, etc.

==2013-04-03T12:15:38-0600 The difference is a set of material processing steps (Rob Guralnick)==

  Steve --- This is my failure of imagination or cogency, but the difference between a starfish in a jar on a museum collection and a starfish on a beach is a set of material processing steps that happen during collection and curation.  That simple, really. 

Best, Rob

==2013-04-03T18:28:03+0000 Agrees with Rob (Kris Krishtalka)==

And Rob beat me to this comment.  Agreed.

Kris

==2013-04-03T15:34:03-0300 basisOfRecord is the type of evidence (John Wieczorek)==
Right, 2 in Briet's Rules. But 2 carries along 1 and 3 anyway, so I fail to see a lack of simplicity.

Key in Steve's assessment, for me, is the realization that basisOfRecord is really the type of evidence.

==2013-04-03T13:30:50-0500 A car isn't a specimen (Steve Baskauf)==

Rob,
Well, it is true that the starfish is a product of material processing steps.  But I would say that is not what makes it a specimen.  My car is the product of material processing steps when it goes from iron ore to a car.  But that doesn't make it a specimen. 

I'm interested in what makes something a specimen in the broadest sense.  Your material processing steps definition doesn't work for a specimen which has no material processing steps, like the Bicentennial Oak.  You could argue that you don't consider the Bicentennial Oak to be a specimen for that reason, but then the Arboretum would have to distinguish between it's accessioned objects that got planted by people and the ones that weren't.  I think they would be happier to think that all of the trees in their collection were specimens regardless of whether somebody planted them or not.

Steve

==2013-04-03T19:57:21+0000 A specimen is processed and accessioned (Kris Krishtalka)==

The car-iron ore analogy is not fitting here, as it starts as iron ore, which through processing is manufactured into at least a car shell.  The starfish is not being manufactured into anything.  It is the same starfish on the beach as it is in the jar.  

In practice of course, a specimen becomes one when it crosses the threshold of the repository.  On the highway, it's roadkill.  In the door of the museum, it's a specimen, because 1. between the door and the jar the material processing occurs; and (2) the repository, through that material processing, which includes accessioning, takes legal possession of the object.

==2013-04-03T17:13:54-0300 OK, complicated (John Wieczorek)==

OK, so it's more complicated in (someone's) reality, not less. ;-)

==2013-04-03T14:44:21-0700 Questions about many cases; the role of data collection; definitions according to biologists and computer scientists (Robert J Robbins)==

Let's start with the Bicentennial Oak. It was there before the arboretum. The arboretum "grew up" around the oak. It seems to me that what makes it a "specimen" is that someone decided to start paying attention to it, either by labelling it in the field, or noting its existence in records, or in some other way.

Chances are, there are also some fungal assemblages in the arboretum, that like the oak, were there before the arboretum, but which are not specimens because no one is paying attention to them.

Let's jump over the starfish and consider some other organisms. We all seem to agree that a starfish becomes a specimen when I pick it up, take it back to the museum, and do whatever accessioning stuff needs to be done.

What if I leave it in the field, but tag it or otherwise label it, then periodically collect data about it. Specimen or wild? Is the physical tagging somehow important?

How about a bird that I have banded and released? Specimen, or not?

Researchers who work on Orcas can identify individual whales by their markings. Often an individual whale is studied for years without ever being touched physically -- observations only. Are these observed Orcas specimens or not? Suppose we take a tissue sample from one observed whale. Does that have any effect on the specimen status of the tissue sample? What about of the whale?

Suppose a whale dies and the carcass is recovered. Surely then it is a specimen. Does that retroactively affects its specimen status in any way?

How about a bird that is observed and counted in a christmas bird count, but no other data are available. Specimen or not? Suppose during a christmas bird count a bird flies into a window, so I pick up the body and later turn it into a study skin. Specimen? What if I collect the body only verify the information on the bird count (it's some warbler and I can confirm the species only with the bird in hand) and then I discard the body. Specimen (deaccessioned?) or not?

I get the feeling from what has been discussed earlier that specimenhood seems to lie in the relationship between an individual organism and the collection of data about that individual organism.

But what if the organism is not an individual, such as a lichen. With some lichens, I can "capture an individual" (a composite with one fungal component and one algal component). Then I can treat it to kill off the algae and I can then induce the surviving fungal component to merge with a different algal component? Under this circumstance, how many specimens are involved?

What about lichens that turn out to be more complex than just one fungus and one algae?

What about a biofilm? I scrape it off the rock and put in a jar. Specimen?

-----

I think that Steve has raised some very subtle, yet very important ontological issues here -- some that cut to the heart of new thinking about biodiversity.

If our very fundamental ontological concepts in biodiversity and collections management end up being anchored on the ontological concept of "individual organism" and if "individual organism" turns out to be a "useful approximation", not a "fundamental construct in objective reality", then there is some serious ontological work ahead of us...

-----

Years ago when I was involved in designing and deploying an institutional HR database, there was a lot of concern about defining an employee, vs a patient, vs a board member, vs a volunteer, vs ...

As we looked at how other institutions had handled these distinctions, we found one place that just had a collection of "people of interest to our organization". That became (more or less) the root class for all classes of people. Then all of the classes that were actually more important to the functioning of the institution became daughter classes of this master class.

-----

One of the challenges here is that, speaking broadly, biologists tend to be interested in central tendencies whereas computer scientists are interested in boundary properties. An information system to support biological research must handle central tendencies (i.e., typical cases) well enough (and conceptually simply enough) to seem useful to a typical biologist. It must also handle boundary conditions (outliers, weird situations, special cases) with sufficient robustness to serve as a functioning information system.

When the genome data base was built at Hopkins as part of the human genome project, to make it work like biologists we had to build in way more complexity and subtlety than any biologist thought necessary (or even reasonable). In some cases, we could never get enough complexity into it to make it generically useful. One would think that a database of human genes would need some good, comprehensive, exhaustive definition of "gene" in order to work.

However, I consistently ran into situations where I would ask a biologist for a definition of a gene, then apply that definition to a complex region of some genome and say to the biologist that "according to your definition of gene, there are nine genes in that region." At this point the biologist might say, "No, there are only four genes there." Even if I showed that the definition REQUIRED that one say that there were nine genes present, I would still get a response to the effect that (a) there were only four genes present, (b) the definition was fine as is (meaning that it satisfied a central tendency definition of gene), and (c) I should quit being so obsessed over details that did not affect one's ability to do biology.


==2013-04-03T15:14:38-0700 How we define classes (Ramona Walls)==

It doesn't matter semantically what you call a class (although it does matter to the people using the ontology), but it matters a lot how you define it. If you want the class "specimen" to include live plants in an arboretum, then define it so it encompasses them. The key is to think of the characteristics that are necessary and sufficient for your class, then include them in the logical definition (as well as possible).  So far in the BCO, we have only defined a class "material sample", and it specifies that some material sampling process took part (which includes selection, extraction, and submission). Clearly this does not cover a tree in an arboretum. However, we could make a broader class called something like "institutional specimen" that would cover material samples plus live specimens. This is straightforward, once we agree on the criteria for an institutional specimen (and that doesn't seem very hard).

We don't currently have any restrictions on what kind of material goes into a material sample, so it could be an organism, a collection of organisms, or a rock.

==2013-04-03T15:15:52-0700 Roles, processes, and samples sensu BCO/OBI (John Deck)==

Applying BCO/OBI to this issue.... 

BCO/OBI (as subprojects of BFO) models material samples, processes, and roles somewhat separately from each other.  Each of these concepts live in different parts of the BFO hierarchy.  This gives some flexibility in assigning roles independent from sampling process or what type of entity it is.  Thus, the important distinction here is between "role" and "material sample".  The definition of "role" in OBI is: 

"A realizable entity the manifestation of which brings about some result or end that is not essential to a continuant in virtue of the kind of thing that it is"

E.g.  the tree in the arboretum can have multiple roles:  a "living specimen" (as Steve suggests), a "preserved specimen" (if a leaf was put in a herbarium back in 1900), and even a "cultural artifact" (e.g. suppose John Brown was hung on this particular tree as well), in addition to being just a tree.  I think separating "roles" and "processes" here is especially important in considering how we want to go about integrating MIxS and DwC as certainly the roles we think about in assigning to objects will vary depending on the type of investigation one is intending.  And the point being, the "objects" in question need to be able to have multiple "roles" as well as multiple types of sampling "processes".  Examples of processes that can act on this tree are: observation (information stored in someones head or written down), processes that yield an information artifact of the entity (e.g. photographs), and physical extraction (taking a leaf from the tree).

==2013-04-04T09:15:57+0200 MIMARKS perspective (Pelin Yilmaz)==

I wanted to share our take on specimen in MIxS, but reading through this whole thread I realized we haven't given as much thought into the description as we should have.

Nevertheless, the MIMARKS checklist (the MIxS that covers single gene amplification metadata), distinguishes between two investigation types; survey and specimen. MIMARKS-survey is supposed to apply to bulk sampling and sequencing type studies of single genes (the usual study type in microbial ecology), while we defined MIMARKS-specimen for marker gene sequences obtained from any material identifiable by means of specimens. Here, I think the idea behind was to be apply the MIMARKS-specimen checklist to pure cultures of microbial organisms.

I realize we are a bit vague, but I'm looking forward to this group resolving what a specimen is, so that we can apply the description to MIMARKS.
